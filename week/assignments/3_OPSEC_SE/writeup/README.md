#Part 1
I would come up to Eric Norman and introduced myself as a person who looks after senior citizens. Hello Eric, My name is Shawn from Senior Living Homes, We provide senior living services at a great discount, if we get commitment from you and your parents that they will use our services when that time comes. These benefits will save you and your parents a great ton of money in the long run. But, firstly, i will need to lock you guys in as soon as possible if you interested as this offer is time sensitive. To do this, i will need you parents information from their names to ATM card number and pin number. The card will not be charged until when they start using the facility. As a security precaution, we will need to know the name of her first pet as the this will be the security question. So, that everytime she contacts us, we will ask her the security question inorder to acess her file and her assist her in what way we can.

exposed Ports.
I would advise Eric Norman to build a firewall, this will help him detect some suspicious activities.  
As shaw stated in her blog that "firewalls are usually configured to detect scans." (shaw, 2019) 
Knowing that your opens are being scanned can help you cut off the connection or if you are savvy try to understand what the attackers where looking for. 

Weak Password
Creating a strong password will make it harder for the hacker to guess Eric's password.
But, this does not guarantee that his password will not be compromised.
What guarantees good security is Eric changing his password atleast once every months. 
"it is recommended to change your password every 6 months or so regardless of whether or not the password has been shared." (calyptix, 2016).
One other thing that eric can do is to get an encrypted password and also use an encrypted USB or a password managing program to safe guard his master password list.

Digital trail
Advise Eric to think before he posts on social media platforms as this was one of the ways i could snoop around and gather as much information as possible.
 "Trawling for personal details is the modern day equivalent of "dumpster-diving", in which strong-stomached thieves would trawl through bins searching for personal documents, says Symantec's John", according to james silver reporting on 20 ways to keep your internet identity safe from hackers.
